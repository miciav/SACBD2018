\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
%The EW-Shopp ecosystem aims to support e-commerce, Retail and Marketing industries in improving their efficiency and competitiveness through providing the ability to perform predictive and prescriptive analytics over integrated and enriched large data sets using open and flexible solutions. 
In this paper, we have outlined the architecture of a platform designed to transform, link and extend massive data sets that provides support in both design time and run time. The architecture features three logical layers with distinct tasks, with tool support for both design-time and run-time (definition of data clean-up and transformation, definition of data workflows and their execution). As of the time of the writing of this paper, the EW-Shopp platform is under development. A prototype of the platform, which implements the Processing and Data Wrangler components (other components and inputs are emulated using APIs), has been deployed and used in the EW-Shopp project. The deployment has been used to successfully implement a data workflow to continously clean-up, transform, enrich data in the magnitude of 100s of gigabytes of data at near real time with outputs close to 1 terabyte of enriched data.

%design component, which provides the user with advanced tools to design a transformation and enrichment pipeline working  on an reduced version of the original data set, and a run time system, which realizes the full-scale execution of the resulting pipeline.

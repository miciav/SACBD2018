\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
%The EW-Shopp ecosystem aims to support e-commerce, Retail and Marketing industries in improving their efficiency and competitiveness through providing the ability to perform predictive and prescriptive analytics over integrated and enriched large data sets using open and flexible solutions. 
In this paper, we have outlined the architecture of a platform designed to transform, link and extend massive data sets. The architecture features three logical tiers with distinct tasks, providing support for both design-time and run-time (definition of data clean-up and transformation, definition of data flows and their execution). As of the time of the writing of this paper, the EW-Shopp platform is under active development. A prototype of the platform has been deployed and tested for project business cases. Moreover, preliminary experiments have been carried out where the prototype has been used to successfully execute a data flow to continuously clean-up, transform, enrich sample data in the magnitude of \textasciitilde 1TB data demonstrating the viability of the approach and showing promising performance.

%design component, which provides the user with advanced tools to design a transformation and enrichment pipeline working  on an reduced version of the original data set, and a run time system, which realizes the full-scale execution of the resulting pipeline.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
%The EW-Shopp ecosystem aims to support e-commerce, Retail and Marketing industries in improving their efficiency and competitiveness through providing the ability to perform predictive and prescriptive analytics over integrated and enriched large data sets using open and flexible solutions. 
In this paper, we have tried to pursue several objectives at once. Mainly, we have outlined a architecture specifically designed to transform, link and extend massive data sets supporting both design time and run time phases. 
This architecture is based on the principle of the data set Dimension Reduction that is an appropriate reduction the size of the data set, to make possible the agile definition a data enrichment process and the full-scale exectution of the resulting pipeline. 
Finally, we have tried to propose an initial implementation of the architecture by identifying one or more tools for each component of the reference architecture. In particular, at this stage we have embraced the lean development approach. Nevertheless, we believe that the reference architecture and its implementation will be able to guide the development process that will take place in the coming months.
